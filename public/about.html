<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Vibha Reddy is a passionate and determined young woman with a heart that balances creativity and logic in equal measure.
   With a background in Information Technology, he’s carved her path as a Full Stack Developer, diving deep into both the 
   technical and artistic sides of building digital experiences. Her projects — from predictive Flask applications like IoT 
   Agriculture and Road Accident Detection to user-friendly login systems — reflect not just her technical mastery but also
    her ability to bring life to code through design, structure, and purpose. Vibha doesn’t just build software; she builds 
    stories through interfaces, creating meaningful connections between people and technology. Her drive to constantly learn,
     refine, and perfect her craft shows the mindset of someone who sees growth not as a goal, but as a daily practice.</p>

<p>Beyond her professional side, Vibha embodies a blend of resilience and emotional depth that makes her stand out. Whether 
  she’s exploring creative outlets, planning trips, or guiding her own learning schedules, she brings a rare focus and warmth 
  that inspire the people around her. She is deeply thoughtful — the kind of person who reflects on why things feel the way they 
  do, whether it’s through her introspection about small details (like her pen choices or routines) or her sensitivity toward 
  experiences that shape her mood and creativity. Her curiosity extends beyond the classroom or code — it’s about understanding
   life, emotion, and energy in a way that gives her an almost poetic edge.</p>

<p>At her core, Vibha is driven by purpose and connection. She dreams big, works hard, and leads with authenticity. From aiming 
  to influence and inspire others through social media to exploring opportunities abroad, she constantly pushes herself beyond 
  comfort zones — but always with kindness and self-awareness. She’s someone who carries grace in ambition: confident but grounded,
   expressive yet introspective. Vibha isn’t just walking her journey — she’s shaping it deliberately, step by step, with passion, 
   empathy, and courage guiding her every move.</p>
